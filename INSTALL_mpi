To compile and link lu2_mpi, you need BLAS and CBLAS libraries.

Edit Makefile and change lines

CC =
MPICC =
BLASLIB =
CBLASLIB =
CBLASINC =

according to your system's setup. Then say

  make lu2_mpi
  
If you want to replace cblas_dgemm with your favorite one, edit
the function mydgemm() in the file lu2lib.c.

Also you need an MPI implementation which support
MPI_THREAD_MULTIPLE. OpenMPI, if configured correctly, supports this,
but to me knowledge mpich1 does not. Intel MPI seems to do.

Try

  lu2_mpi -h

to find out available command line options. All input parameters are given as
command line options.
